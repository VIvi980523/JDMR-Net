JDMR-Net: Joint Detection and Modulation Recognition Networks for LPI Radar Signals

We developed the code for the method proposed in the paper "JDMR-Net: Joint Detection and Modulation Recognition Networks for LPI Radar Signals" as "JDMR_Net.py". 

For situations where computing resources are limited, we suggest using the lightweight version of our network, which is available as "JDMR_Net_light.py".

The folder "JDMR_Net_100epochs" contains the model trained on cropped data samples for 100 epochs, and the corresponding cropped test data can be found in the "test_sample" folder. Due to confidentiality reasons, the original data samples cannot be provided.
